Based on High-accuracy detection of early Parkinson's Disease paper by Warwick R. Adams available here: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188226#abstract0
Data obtained from https://physionet.org/content/tappy/1.0.0/ 

About: 

This is a program intending to create a meta-predictor for high detection of Parkinson's Disease using only keystroke data. 

How to use: 

To make this program work effectively, make only the following changes to the program:

1) Change the location of the data files in your computer.

Once that is done, it should work.

End:

Please note that this program works best in Google Collab as it was originally written in that platform. I will be creating desktop versions later as soon as possible. 

This program is also incomplete as of 27 June 2020 as I plan to add k folds cross validation to this.

If you encounter any problems, please shoot me an email at rishabhjain68@gmail.com. I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.
