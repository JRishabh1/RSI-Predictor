About: 

This is a program intending to create a meta-predictor for high detection of Parkinson's Disease using only keystroke data, written in python. 

How to use: 

To make this program work effectively, make only the following changes to the program:

1) Change the location of the data files in your computer.

Once that is done, it should work.

End:

Please note that this program works best in Google Collab as it was originally written in that platform. I will be creating desktop versions later as soon as possible. 

If you encounter any problems, please shoot me an email at rishabhjain68@gmail.com. I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.
